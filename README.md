# Open2World - Your online file converter

Hi, we are Open2World, your easiest and fast file converter

## 2024-05-06 (**Alpha** Release)

Open2World is designed to convert Parquet and SAS Files to CSV format in just few steps.

## What Open2World Does

We are offering a seamless, efficient, and reliable solution for data conversion, allowing users to swiftly and securely distribute valuable information to a broad audience.

### Is there a limit on file conversions

Yes, indeed, we currently have limits in place. We're actively working to test our app and expand our infrastructure to handle various workloads before removing these limits.

### File Formats

For now, we're only converting SAS Files and Parquet files. Why? To be honest, we don't have a specific reason. We're currently focused on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our project, and based on our team's experience, we've selected these formats.
